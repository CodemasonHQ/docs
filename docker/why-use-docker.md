# Why use Docker?

Docker is super popular for a reason.

Docker lets you build and run your application in a standardized way. 
Your apps can be be easily and consistently run on any local dev machine or host.

This level of consistency is what makes Docker so appealing. Since the Docker image contains everything your 
software needs to run, you can take your image and deploy it to any server, scale it across multiple servers 
or even just run it as a development environment on your local machine.
