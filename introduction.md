# Welcome to Codemason
Every developer knows the frustration all too well â€” writing code only to have your flow broken by needing to configure your environment, server or deployment process.

Then before you know it, you're 5 tabs deep into how you can solve your problem in 10 different ways.

Of course, we'll repeat this process a handful of times while we stitch together a bunch of the DevOps stuff that we **must have** because otherwise our project isn't a *real* project...

Once we've successfully thrown our adhoc DevOps process together, we can slowly back away from our house of cards. Only to do it all again for the next project.

Codemason was passion project borne out of that frustration.


# What is Codemason?
Codemason helps developers build, deploy and manage their application.

We walk a fine line between Platform as a Service and Containers as a Service. 

You could probably call us *"DevOps as a Service"*. We handle or simplify DevOps related stuff that gets in the way of developers actually developing without crippling you if you outgrow us!

> I think of Codemason as a needle and thread that ties together various concepts, practices and open source projects in a simple, natural and intuitive way. 

Here's what really sets Codemason apart:

We don't believe in black magic and we don't like sneaky lock in tactics. We want to operate as close to an open source project as possible.


Out of the box, Codemason gives developers
- Continuous deployment
- Difference environments (e.g. testing, staging, production)
- Load balancing 
- One click provisioning of services like MySQL, Redis etc.
